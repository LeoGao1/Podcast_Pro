    "text = \"All right, welcome, guys. At this point, I think many of you have been moved into the class from the waitlist. So that's good. At this point, the remaining spots on the waitlist will just open up if if people drop. Um, So if you're enrolled in the class or if you're on the waitlist and wanna do the work to (Thio,) keep up with the class. The first assignment is out. The lab was posted this weekend and it's due on Friday. So many of you have started it. I was happy to see that if you haven't started it, you'll definitely be able to start after today because we'll go over a lot of like the basic programming stuff today. (on Dhe.) And Then we just released the first homework, which is gonna be due Monday of next week. So if you want to follow along with the notebook that I'm doing today could go to the class website, which is dsc 10 dot com on the schedule town. If you hit the word lecture, it'll take you to Jupiter Hub, where you can log in um it may not grab the newest contents of my lecture directory because you have to click the link after you log in. So log in, then go back here and click the link again, and then it should grab the latest stuff. Okay, um, I have a copy of it running locally on my computer so I don't have to rely on the Internet. The Internet's a little bit patchy in this building, So this is a Jupiter notebook. If you haven't started the lab yet, this is the environment in which we'll be working. Uh, Jupiter notebooks used to be called I Python Notebooks. So the file extension, I guess you can kind of see it up here is that I pi and B, um, stands for I python notebook. So python is the programming language that we use. Jupiter notebooks are the like interface that we see. And Numb Pie is one of many packages of sort of predefined tools that can help you. I have my notebook set up. Thio go in this presentation mode so you won't be able to do this unless you download some extra stuff. But it's the same content that's displayed in the notebook, just like in a more friendly form for presentation. Okay, so we're gonna learn programming in this class as I told you last time. And python is the tool that will use a lot (There's lots) of different languages but pythons particularly popular for data science, because it's fairly easy to learn, and it doesn't have a lot of overhead and complicated ways of doing things. Um, so in this class will learn just as much as we need to actually start answering questions about data. The notebook environment that we're using, as you can see has text in there as well as code. So their these Jupiter notebooks air really useful not just for like, writing programs, but for presenting data analysis right so often, When you answer data science question, you want your insight to be used for some purpose, like maybe business, right? You're tryingto analyze something about a business and make recommendations for how the business should should act based on the data. So you might find yourself needing to present the data analysis you've done to an audience, right? So this is nice, because you can combine the code with slide show text presentations um in addition to (toe) presenting. It's also good for yourself. So, like annotate what you're doing. If you're working with partners or teams, it's really helpful that you can have, like, text or equations. Even you can write math equations with nice formatting, so you can really like. Basically, you can write a textbook in a Jupiter notebook, and that is what your DSC 10 textbook is (ISS). Last time. I think I've tried showing you the interact button on the textbook. So links and resource is on. Our website has the textbook and just goto a certain chapter. If I want to interact with it, it gives me basically Ah, the Jupiter notebook from which the text book was created, right, and you can play around with it. Last time the this interact link was broken, but I believe that they fixed it now. So we'll see. So yeah, this is like the notebook that is your textbook, right? So in a sense, your textbook is just a bunch of different Jupiter notebooks put together on this website, and you can play around with it. You can actually execute cells, but Jupiter notebooks are really useful for the type of thing we're doing in this class, but they're not the most useful thing for all purposes. There's lots of different programming languages and different environments that are good for different things. Jupiter notebooks aren't really good for big projects because they're slower. So if you're doing like a real big software development project, you'd choose some sort of, ah compiled language like Java C (Sea) or something. But it's perfect for what we need in this class. Okay, I'm gonna get out of the slideshow mood so I can show you. The different data type are the different types of cells. So the notebook is broken up into these sequences of sort of boxes, which are called cells, and every cell has has a type. There's actually more than two types. You can change the type of a cell right there in the menu. Up there. Mark down is what we'll use for text and code is what we'll use for python code. So this cell right now its type is marked down. You see that right there? Um, and if you wantto look at a code cell click on this one, right, it says that it's code. So I said that a notebook can mix text with code, so code is code, Right, But text is marked down. All right, so Mark down is actually ah ah, formatting language. And it looks like text looks like a bulleted list right here. But if you double click it, this is like the underlying, uh, formatting that tells the notebook to display these words in a certain way. So notebook cells have two types. That was kind of the header of my slide. Uh, the fact that there's this pound sign in front of a makes it be a header. If I put £2 in front of it, it's a smaller header. Right? So the more pound signs you put, the smaller it looks. Uh, what else? These asterisks. What do you think they dio? That's like the bullet points. Yeah, And then there's also these single quote things around it. Let me try taking it out, and I'll show you. Do you see the difference? It's pretty hard to see on the projector, but, um, the word code as this gray highlighting in the word mark down doesn't so that came from having these tick marks around it. Okay, so basically marked down is like a formatting language, and it allows you d'oh display text however you want, right? So it's kind of like a, you know, word processing in a way, but it's it's more simplistic. It can't quite do as much in this class. This is not at all the focus of the class, right, but it's just good to know how to do basic things like change the type of your cell and howto I don't know type things, and you'll you'll learn any markdown you need as you go. What Basically, what you'll be doing in class is changing the code cells and will provide the mark down cells, which have explanations of the problems and what you need to do. Does that make sense? So I'll go back to my slide view. The part that you're gonna be working in is these code cells, so python basically can act like a calculator. You can type in some expression and ask the computer to evaluate it, right, So I'm sure you've used graphing calculators. I use Google like this all the time to just do simple math things. Well from Alfa, I use like this right So it's just a system that can evaluate expression. So I don't know. What do you want to evaluate? Two times 75 Right? Uh, the way I enter the way I get the computer to actually calculate it is I hold down the shift key while I press enter. If you're in the er regular notebook of you, then there's a run button, this one, which does the same thing. But it's a lot faster t to do the shortcuts, so shift enter is like the most used thing that you'll you'll do all quarter. Whenever I teach this class, I get in such a habit of pressing shift. Enter that whenever I'm just like writing an email or something. I'm always like Shift enter shift enter. Just become second nature. Uh, so, yeah, you can type standard sort of math expressions and have it evaluate for you. All right, so it's not really mind blowing, but it's important thing to be able to do. Yeah, so this is all sort of within Jupiter. Jupiter is a cell based model where you can run little pieces of code at a time. If you were like typing a python program you'd have to, like, run the entire program. Yeah, Um, so, the way sort of the computer, like seize your (Caesar) code and turns it into something. It basically has these three steps. It reads what you've written. It evaluates what that answer should be right, And then it prints the outcome. If you put a, uh, a pound sign in front of something, it becomes a comment. Right. So you can write text, you can write expressions. You can write whatever you want, but it's not gonna be looked at, right? So if I put a pound sign in front of one plus two and then do three times seven, right, it doesn't even really look at the one plus two. It ignores the comments and adjust as of the code. So if you have multiple expressions, he said, if you have multiple expressions, it can't do both of them three times seven and five plus five. So it only shows you 10. So actually, the computer is calculating both of them, but only displays the last expression. If I want to see the answers to both things, I just need to do them separately. I could do three times seven here and I could d'oh five plus five here. Okay, um, let's talk about these little numbers. These numbers on the left 46 and seven, sort of keep account of which sells I've executed in what order? So the very first thing I execute in the notebook the very first cell Where do shift Enter has a one in it? It was the first thing that I asked it to Dio and its output was the first thing to come out. All right, so this sort of keeps track of the history of what commands you've done. In what order? Um, things could get very confusing. If you run your notebook out of order, I can probably show you an example of that later. But as a general, practice like tryto work your way from the top down. And that's why before we have you submit your homework, we ask you to, like, run everything from the top down. And that catches a lot of problems because sometimes people think that they passed because they were able to get the test to pass. But when you run it from top to bottom, it doesn't pass because they somehow like did things out of order to get it to pass. And the way we grade A is always by doing it in order. That's a really good question. No, they're all independent. So if you run self or you're just running cell four Yeah, that makes it fast. Because, you know, if you had 100 cells and if you were in cell 100 required to do all the other ones would be, like a long process. Yeah. No. So we'll talk about imports later, but you just do it once at the beginning, and it'll sort of keep it for the rest of the program. Okay. Anything else? Um where's five? Why does it go for six? Seven Kind of can explain, but you mean I deleted it. Oh, did I delete the cell? I can't. I don't think I did. What did I D'oh in the back? Right. Let's run the third cell again. Now it's the A thing I did, right? So that's that. Third cell was both was sick. This was it. The seven thing that I did and the thing that I did right, but it only shows the most recent one. Does that make sense. And while it's working, I don't know if you notice it's pretty fast. But there's an asterisk, all right, that means it's it's thinking. And if your program gets stuck on that asterisk, it could be hung up. Uh, so let me show you sort of what to do and go to Colonel Interrupt and then Colonel Restart, kind of like starts everything again. Questions those three cells. Yeah, here. Well, now would be 10. There's a tent thing I've done in the notebook. Yeah, that makes sense. So what can you do with Python? All the basic arithmetic stuff. Here's a table of stuff. The operate the operators that you use are pretty standard except exponents is a little unusual. Most programs would use a carrot symbol for that, but this uses a double asterisk, and Python knows the standard sort of order of operations. You couldn't put parentheses. Thio make it easier for people to understand, Right? So this says two to the power for gonna writhe two to the power for times three to the power one times for all right. What's to the 4 16 times? Three times, for that's what it's doing. Um, 192. The parentheses aren't necessary here because the order of operations says that you do all the exponentially ation first, and then you do all the multiplication, so I'm gonna get the same answer. But does anyone wanna look at this and, like, figure out what it's trying to? D'oh, That's horrible, right? So it's a lot more readable when you put the parentheses. So even though it's not always necessary, it's always a good idea. Um, this one, the parentheses are actually mattering, right. This is six squared, and if I remove the parentheses, it becomes three squared, which is nine times two is 18 right? So it matters. Okay, So, up until now we basically just been using python as a calculator, right? Google can do this. Lots of other programs could do this. Um, this is where you start being able to dio something more useful and interesting, right? Have you ever used the answer button A. N s on a graphing calculator? What's that button do? Yeah, sort of grabs the previous answer and saves it so that you can use it again in a calculation. Right. So if you're a calculation has lots of steps. You can do it in pieces, take the previous answer, and then double it and then take that answer and subtract something from it. Whatever. Um, so the way that that python handles this sort of thing of keeping track of a previous result and allowing you to use it again is with variables. So variable is just ah, sort of a box in the memory of the computer. I think of it as, like a designated space for some value that you get to decide. All right, so the value could be any expression, and the variable could have any name. So you get to name your variable, and you get to decide what value it takes on. Um, And the way you do that is making a statement like this the variable name you use the equal sign and then you put an expression and what this does is it changes. The meaning of the variable name, toe toe have the value of the expression. Right. So after this, the variable called my variable, it's equal to the five. It's not equal to the two plus three expression. Basically, it evaluates the expression and saves that as my variable. Kind of like the answer button on a calculator. Right. If you got some answer on your calculator by doing the quadratic formula or something and you saved it as answer. Once you start using that answer in a later calculation, it doesn't remember where the answer came from or that it was the result of a quadratic formula, Right? It just knows what the number waas. Right. So it's just the value that gets saved, Not the expression. Okay, So what happens when you run? Uh, an assignment statement like this? These are called assignment statements. Well, what happened? Seems like nothing happened. Right? Um, but something did happen. Just doesn't show you what happened. So when it says my variable equals All right, my variable is not a name that the python program has ever seen before. Right? This is the first time it's encountering those those letters. M Y v a r i a b l e. Right. It doesn't know what that means. You could put your first name. You could put anything you want there. It doesn't know what it means, right? So it sees something in it, interprets it as a variable which I just think of as, like, some set aside space, right? And then what is it gonna put in that space? You? The equal sign tells it what to put in that space. So two plus three, it evaluates that to five, and it puts five there. Okay, but how do I know that anything happened, right? It didn't output anything like my previous cells have done. Um, I can just type the name of the variable, and it will show me what what it contains. All right. So that's how you can check that. Something actually happened as you expected. If you just take the name of a variable, it displays the contents of that box and memory. So typing the name of a variable displays its value. Great. Okay, so what if I run this in excel? My variable equals two plus 40 yeah, Go ahead. Well, they run independently, but they sort of so yeah, running Sell 17 doesn't cause cell 15 to go. But since cell (sell) 15 already went right when I did sell 15. That saved the value five as my variable. And now I'm just asking, What's my variable? Right, Right. They're not like separate programs are like they do build on one another, but they're independent in the sense that running sell 17 doesn't rerun. Sell 15. Yeah. Um, so this is pretty similar to the answer button on your calculator, right? If you just type, answer and then enter, it'll show you what? That answer waas, right? If you type answer plus five, it'll show you five more than what your answer was. Okay. And just like on a calculator, you can update the value of answer by doing a different calculation. Right? And I can update the value of my variable by doing a different calculation. So this next cell, right? What's it going to? D'oh! It's going to make a box and memory called my variable, But this already has a box and memory called my variable. So it's not gonna make a new one. It's going to use the same one, right? So it's basically just gonna change the value that stored here. So it used to be five. What's it gonna be now? Two plus four. So it just replaces the value with six. And once it's been replaced, you have no way of figuring out what it used to be. It's just one spot, one number. You're not keeping track of its history. Great. So here's my variable. If I ask for its value now, I'll get six. Right. So let me run these again. I'm setting my variable toe five. I'm asking for its value. Its five setting my variable to six. I'm asking for its value. Its six. Yeah. Yeah, this is a good question. So try running cell 20. Okay, So that first cell I've just run. Now I'm going to skip this. Skip this. Run this. What's it gonna print? Five. The thing that's in my box right now, it's five. And this is a good illustration of why you want to run yourselves in order, right? Because if you're looking at this right, it looks like assuming that you ran everything in order, it looks like my variable is printing five. When it's supposed to be printing six. That could be potentially very confusing. Um, so if you run everything in order than like, the output will be consistent with what you expect. Does that make sense? Oh, another thing I wanted to show you was if you're tryingto let's say, display the output or type of variable name. You could just start typing and then hit tab. It's super useful. Especially if you have a lot of variable names. You don't remember exactly what you called it, right? Tab is how you auto complete. Okay, so my variable is five now, try doubling the value of my variable. So it seems like to double it. I would need to multiply it by two. So then I get 10. Who? I'm gonna move things. Okay, so my variable is 10. But if I ask for it to display the value, it actually shows five. Right? So that's the correction. That's what I need to do to fix what went wrong. Good. Yeah, sure. Right. So all I have done right is ask for an expression, right? I'm just using the computer like a calculator and asking, What do I get if I multiply that number by two and it tells me, but it doesn't save it anyway unless you ask for it to be saved. Right? So basically, my variable was set to five, and I asked it to take that value and double it, and it just did that and showed me the answer. But what's in my box? Still five. Right. So if you want to update your box, you have to do this. Take that result, which is 10. Right? And store it in my variable. That makes sense. So the way you you read this expression This statement, this assignment statement it's called, is you Look at the expression on the right and that's some value, right? And you assign that value to the variable name on the left. So this works now. But this points out something that's pretty different about the way the equal sign is used here, right? Mathematically, if you read this as an equal sign, right, this doesn't make sense. My variable equals my variable. Times two. That's like saying X equals X times two, right. The only solution that has zero. Um, but my variables, not zero. Right? So I'm not using the equal sign to mean that the item on the left is equal to the item on the right. I'm using the equal sign as an assignment, so I think a better choice of symbol. It would have been like a left arrow, and then it would say like my variable. Where is getting place? Something is getting placed into it right? And the thing that's getting placed into it is my variable times two. So when I read these statements allowed, I don't say my variable equals my variable times, too. I say my variable gets my variable. Times two. I use the word gets to describe what's happening that variable. That space and memory is being assigned some value. So try to think of it like that. That will help a lot. I think. Any questions on those examples? Okay, the probably one of the most common mistakes that we see in this class is Is this changing the value, wanting to change the value of a variable, but not saving it back in the variables name? So then it's just computing some change, but just printing and throwing it away, and the underlying variable doesn't get changed. All right, so that's what I had originally. I just had my variable times two. Right. I need to set my variable equal to that value. Yeah, so that's a shorthand. That means the same thing. We won't use that in this class. It means exactly that. Okay, So let's see what happens here. This illustrates another difference between the use of the equal sign and programming versus in math. So this is a signing x 22 and it's a signing wide of three. More than that, right? So what do you think's why is gonna be five, right? But if I change X 24 why stays us five? All right, this makes perfect sense when you think of the box, right? That's why I really like this box. It's saying the first line make a box called X Put two in there. The second line is saying, Makes up. Make a box called Why Put three plus X in there and to figure out what X is. It looks at this spot, and it sees the two, so it puts three plus two or five there. Right Then the second cell changes extra for and then the last cell. I'm simply asking what's in the box for why it's five, right? But this is very different from math, because in math, this line y equals three plus X would be defining a relationship between X and Y. That would be saying that why is exactly three more than X. Right? And if that were true, then the value of X would determine the value of why and why would always be three more than X, right? So, in math, if Y equals three plus X and X were four, right, then why would be seven? And that's not how it happens here. Right? So these are sort of subtle differences. And if you keep this memory model the boxes in mind, I think it helps a lot. Ok, any questions so far? Yeah. Sorry. Say that again. Why? Um, I guess it's a Jupiter, but lots of different programming languages have something like that. Yeah. Okay, call expressions. So, so far, you've just been doing expressions by the basic math symbols, plus times, divides, subtraction. But there's more things you might want to do. Like even your graphing calculator right has more features than this. It could take the sign of a number the log of a number of the absolute value of a number. Right? So these things exist in python and they're called functions, just like in math. The input to a function is called an argument. So this is a function absolute value function. It takes as an input a number right and returns the positive version of that number. Sport return zero if the input A zero. Right, So this works just like normal, absolute value from math. But this a B s was like a special thing. That python knew what to d'oh, right? I didn't tell it what a B s meant at all. It just sees those letters and interprets it to me in the absolute value and knows how to do that. Right? So notice this displacing green. That's like a special indicator that Python is treating this as as a special function. So ABS is a pre existing built in function. There are others that I'll show you in a little bit in general focus. Not so much unlike learning the specifics off of the things that I'm doing. But more of like the concepts and techniques on tests and stuff will give you a list of available functions, right? So it's not just like, do you know what this huge list of things condo's. We'll give you the huge list of things and what it can do and will ask you questions of like, how you put them together and answer a question about data. Um, you can name functions, right? So absolute value has its own name. A B s. Right. But what if I want to call it something else? Maybe I want to call it f, right? I can (couldn't) do that. So the first line here is an assignment statement. I'm assigning this function Thio a variable called f. Right. So it's a little different than what I've been doing before. I was assigning numbers. Now, now I can assign functions. Um, and then you can just talk about F of X, right? And it's going to do the same calculation that he did earlier. I don't think you need to use that too much, but it's something you can do. Sometimes the number of arguments to a function can be more than one can even vary, Right. So absolute value only took in one one value, right? It wouldn't make sense to ask for the absolute value of multiple things at the same time. Right. But the maximum That's something where you you do need a bunch of things, right? So I'm just asking, what's the largest of these numbers, right? So this has four arguments, but I can take the max of a different number of values, and it still works. All right, So this max function has a varying number of arguments. So one question very natural question is like, How did you know to use ABS and Max? Right? What functions are there and how do they work, Right, So we'll answer the second question first. How do functions work, right, and then I'll show you how to find out what functions are available. So let's say there's a function that you know exist, like the rounding function you want around the number 1.22 It gives you an answer of one, right? But But what exactly did that do? So if you type the name of the function and a question mark, then do you shift? Enter. It'll display at the bottom some documentation for for what the function does. These can be hard thio to read and interpret, especially when you're new. You'll get better with practice at figuring out what this means, so it gives a description of what the function does, and it gives a description off what it takes in as inputs and what it gives out as outputs. So this looks like it takes in a number. The brackets mean that there's an optional additional argument, right? So anything in brackets, you can add it, but you don't have to. So here. I didn't have that second argument, right? I just had the number as the input and the output is a number, right? It took in 1.22 and output it one. So it rounded my input number to a given precision and decimal digits. And the default was no decimal places, right? So it basically rounded it to the nearest integer with no decimal places, um, returns an inch when called with just one argument. Otherwise it would have the same type of the input number. So what if I tried rounding it toe one decimal place 1.2? Okay, if I tried rounding it to two decimal places, you get 1.22 I don't know what happens if you do this three decimal places while there's only two to begin with, so it still gives you two. There's, like, weird stuff. It says you can even, ah, number of digits, maybe negative So what does it mean to around something to minus one digits? I don't know. All right. You have an idea? Yeah. So I think that's what it might mean. Um, like to the nearest multiple of 10. Right. So let's try it out by, like, doing a much bigger number. 11,244. Yeah. 11,240. Let's change this to 11,247. It seems to do what you said round to the nearest multiple of 10 right? But I'm not quite sure. Right. So this is a great time to use Google. Okay, Feel free to look up. Sort of the meaning of python functions. And all your basic python questions can really be answered on Google. So don't be afraid to use that tool. Um, what do you think's gonna happen when I do the last cell in error? Yeah, that's right. What's gonna happen? What's wrong? What? The number of arguments, right? The description of the function waas. It definitely needs the first number that you're going to be rounding. You can optionally give it a number of digits, but you can't give it three things so it's probably gonna be an error. One thing you'll get practice with as you program is interpreting error messages. This one's a fairly easy one to interpret. It says round takes at most two arguments, but three were given, right? So you can input one or two different numbers, but you can't and put three different numbers. No, that makes sense. What, like something like something that's not a function like this are Oh, you Oh, um, yeah, I think that works to, um it depends on the at what was in that library and what they put as a documentation. There's another way of getting the same help, right? When I did the question mark, it sort of was this pop up window at the bottom. If you type the word help surrounding, um, helped parentheses and put the name of the function close parentheses, it gives you the same exact information. But it's sort of just in the notebook. So whichever you prefer. So this is the other question. What functions can you use? This is the list of all the built in functions. A lot of these seem really weird and ones that aren't so useful for for data science, right? If you were working with a bunch of data, what's something you might want to dio? I don't know, like alphabetize it or count how many unique values there are something like that, right? These things aren't aren't in this list. So this is, ah, useful. It's useful to be able to do these things in certain instances, but there's way more that you'd want to be able to do that's not listed here, right? So these are the ones that are built in. But people have put together packages or libraries or modules of functions, which are just like collections of functions, and they make them available toe other people to use. So what we'll do in this class is like pull certain of these packages in and then use the functions that exist in them. So an example of this is the is the math. There's a math module, which is just like a collection of things that you might wanna use if you're doing a math problem, right. Like sign and co sign weren't on this list of built in functions. And unless you want to like, make your own function that given input computes the sign and coastline of it. That would be actually quite hard. I think you only really learn how to do that for for certain multiples of of pi over three or pie over six. Right? Um so it's nice to be able to have somebody else's sign and co sign function, and then you can just use it. So these come in the form of these modules, you need to import whatever collection of functions you want to use by way of an import statement. And then when you want to use one of the functions from these packages, you put the name of the module and a dot in the name of the function within that module, and then you could use it, right? So the mass module is like a really common one, right? Lost People used us to do lots of calculations. So when I do import math, it doesn't show me anything. But what it does is it makes accessible to me a whole bunch of math functions. Now, how do I know which math functions are available? Great math dot because that's how you you're gonna use a function. You do the name of the module. That's, uh that's this. Use the name of the module dot the name of the function. Right. So I know that any sort of math function I want to use has to start with math dot But then I just tab to see what's available. Great. There's lots of things are co sign ceiling, right? I can't see them all. But if I start, I know I want something that starts with D, right. I can start typing, and I don't know what this does. I'm going to guess it. Probably like converts. Radiance. Two degrees. Um, but I don't know. So I'll do the question mark. This is I think what you're asking before, right? Converts an angle from radiance two degrees. All right, so let's try it. What's the A nice one pie. So how do you tie pie, right? I mean, you can type 3.14 but that's not really pie. Right? So you're not really going to get 1 80 right? You can't. You can type more and more digits of pi. What? You can type them. All right, but pie is ah, a special number that exists within this math package. It's a constant within that package. So if I do math dot pie, that's going to give me, like, the value of pi, and it knows that pie radiance is the same as 180 degrees. So here's another math function. The log. It takes two arguments and what would you guess it's doing based on this input in this output? What is it? What calculation is it doing? Yeah, log before the base of two. Yes, so in Matthew would write this log base to four. Great, and you can learn how it works. Bye. Looking at the documentation. What if you didn't put a second argument right? That second argument. The base is optional because it's in square braces. Um, if the base is not specified, it uses. Basie uses natural walk right, so you can learn about what different functions are available. And the math module is just one module for the sake of showing you sort of how modules work. But we'll use different modules based on whatever we're doing. Um, I don't think so, because you need to ask for help with something more specific. Oh, you can, Okay, but it doesn't tell you much. It tells you that it's a module that provides access to mathematical functions. Right. So it's like a a broad description of what the module is. That's good to know. Okay, So based on what we've done, this is ah, clicker question. So our frequency is BC. If you need help with your clicker, this ass somebody nearby. Okay, We didn't We didn't talk about math dot power yet. Does anyone know what it does or have a guest? For what it does power? We actually learned another way to do this, right? We learned the double star for exponents, so it's the same thing Pao takes into arguments. The 1st 1 is the base of the exponents, and the 2nd 1 is the export of value. Um, I know, I think I don't know how it works behind the scenes, but it does essentially the same thing. Like the Alfa should be the same. Yeah. Yeah. All right, everybody vote. I'm going to close a pole and then we'll talk about the answers. All right, I'm gonna close this up, OK? A is a definite problem. What's the problem? It has two arguments, right? You can't take the absolute value of multiple things. All right? People don't really think B is a problem. What's it going to do? It's gonna take acts, which is three to the power of two. And it should give you nine. Okay. C has some votes. D has few votes. He has more than one of the above. Okay, let's see, I programmed them and I typed them in ahead of time so we can just run them right and see what happens. So these were the variables that were defined. This gives you the problem That it's supposed to have one argument, but you gave it to this. Gives you three to the power to, which is nine. Ah, yeah. Look at this. Do you notice the color? It's pretty hard to tell. Probably up here, but but this is red. Okay, so that's a problem. That was tricky, though. That was tricky. That was a trick question. Okay. Is this gonna work now? It still doesn't work. Okay. What's wrong with this Best? Which parts into turn should be float? Uh, does that work? Can you round like 3 to 4 decimals? So it's not like something you'd want to do, right, But it's not gonna given air. But this does actually have problems. Still, does anyone see a problem? Nice. Oh, yeah. Okay, So one problem is the max function. You're only giving it one thing. And Max, it wants, like, several things to choose the largest of them. Right? So let's see. If so, we think the problem is with Max, right? So I'm going to try to isolate that and see if this is where the air comes from. Yeah, that is where the error air comes from. This is ah, example of an error message that's not so easy to understand, right? Unless you, like, had programming experience, you might not understand what this is saying. Um, what this is saying is that the maximum, um, can take multiple arguments, or it can take one argument. But if you give it one argument, it has to be like a list of things, a sequence of values, so that it can go through the entire list and find the largest of them. You can't just give it a single integer (into a chair). So that's the problem, right? And if you look at the documentation for Max it's It's a little bit complicated, right? You can give it either a list, and it will return the biggest item in the list. Or you could give it a specific sequence of arguments, but there has to be at least two. Okay, so that was wrong. Not only for the for the extra parentheses, but also because of the max. All right. Is this one gonna work? Yeah, that works. Okay, so the one potential problem that somebody saw was you were trying to round like a whole number two decimal places, and that gets at the next thing, which is the data type. So there's different types of data, right? Like, just think of an Excel spreadsheet or something. Sometimes you store data as dates, right? Sometimes you store them as currencies. Sometimes you store them as just text. Sometimes you store them as integer value. Sometimes you store them as decimal places. Sometimes you store them as percentages. Right? So there's all these different types and which your data might be formatted and every sort of value. And python has a certain type, and that describes how the how the data is stored. You can always ask python for what's the type of a certain value using a function called type right. So for numbers, which are the main data type that we've seen so far, there's two basic types. Float is for decimal places, basically numbers with decimal places and in just for intruders. So floats are also called floating point numbers. Okay, so it's have arbitrary precision. That means you can store like super huge integers as as large as your computer can handle. There's not gonna be like some limit placed on on you by Python saying that this number is too large for me to store. So if you do some arithmetic, these are the operations, plus minus times and exponentially ation. If you do this arithmetic with two integers, you're going to get an integer back, right? So I used the type to ask, What is the type of the of this value? All right, so the type of two is an int (end), but the type of 2.0 is afloat, right? So anything that has a decimal point, even if it has ah, even if it has just like zero as the as the decimal places, it's it's essentially treating this Storing This is a different type of number than it was when I just type too. But that makes sense. So this next cell demonstrates that it can store really big numbers. Two to the power 6000 is a really big number, but this is the exact answer. It's not like truncating or rounding or cutting it all. Good question. So you might have noticed right that the arithmetic operations I put here did not include division, right? If I I said, if I add two intruders, I get an integer. If I subtract two intruders, I get an integer If I multiply two intruders I couldn't enter. If I exponentially eight, I get an integer. But what happens if I divide well? What is 22 divided by three, right? It's not an integer, so it would be bad if it gave me an integer value. Right? So it does give me a decimal place, gives me a floating point value. Sometimes when you divide wanted to do by another right. The result actually is an integer right. Two divided by two is one that's an integer, but for consistency. It always takes the division of two integers and treats them as a float percent. Oh, module is, um so module is on. Lee really makes sense with, uh, with intruders, I think because this means take 14 divided by three, right? Think of long Division three goes in there four times, three times for his 12. And then there's two left over the Yeah, so it's actually Yeah, I guess you could add that to the list. If you have two integers, it'll give you an integer, right? And if you have at least one of them as a float, then it will give you a float back like, let's try 12.0 divided by three. Right? This goes in perfectly, so there's no remainder, but it displays it as a float, right? The fact that it 0.0 instead of just zero means that it's using it as a float (flu). So once I basically, whenever you do any operation that involves a float, it treats the results as a float. Yeah. Is that okay? Um, floats are specified with the decimal point. Right. Uh, big numbers might be printed using scientific notation. Right. So floats don't have this unlimited precision. You can only store so many decimal points. I think it's like 15 or 16 decimal points. Decimal places are recorded, and after that it doesn't keep track. So the size of a float, meaning like the largest value, could store the smallest value you could store. There is actually like a cap on how big of a number can be used, but it's It's pretty large, and you're unlikely to encounter in this class. So you don't We don't really need to worry about that. Um, the fact that you only store 15 or 16 decimal places can lead to, um, the final few decimal places being wrong. Right? So here's 1\\/3. Right now, this isn't exactly 1\\/3 right. The true value of third has three is going on forever. Right? But this is 1\\/3 with 15 or 16 decimal places. Show right. So if I take 1\\/3 and multiply it by this big number, right, it's, um Essentially, what you would do right is move the decimal place over a bunch. All right, but it doesn't really know that there's more threes over here. Right? So the remaining decimals, um, get get lost, right? Really? These three should go on for 15 or 16 decimal places, but they don't right, and the three changed into it to basically it sort of from rounding, right. It's rounding the actual value of 1\\/3 to this 0.333 number and from rounding. There's a small error, a difference between the true value and what it's supposed to be. So I I liked the example actually, that we had earlier with, um, with the module ISS the remainder. What did we have? 14.2 divided by three, uh, remainder when you divide by three, right, three should go in four times to give you 12 right? And then there's a remaining 2.2. But it wasn't to point to exactly right. It was this number that's really close to 2.2. So sometimes the like final decimal places of floats can be off. And years have to know to know that if you're doing arithmetic with them, there's like techniques. You can do tow to minimize that and the effect that has. But we're not gonna talk about that here. So basically what you need to know is that floats are, um, for decimal places in surfer whole numbers and, uh, integers can express any number, but floats are more limited. Um, sometimes you want to change types, and there's functions to do that. So there's a function called int, which changes a float into an end. Right, And there's a function called float, which changes in an end into a float. All right, so you do end to change it to an end, and you do float to change it to a float. And, um, when you have a mixed expression, it's gonna use float. It's easier and more correct in general, to turn an intern to afloat by putting 0.0 on the end. And it's some. It's often incorrect. Convert a decimal number two an intruder by just ignoring what's after the decimals. Right? So it's sort of like being conservative and safe by converting to floats when it's ambiguous. Great. So this happens automatically if you do 2.0, plus three. Those are two different types, so it treats them both us floats, right? It could have sort of gotten the same result if it treated them both as introduced. Cause two plus three is still five but 2.5 plus three. Now it becomes really important that we're converting to floats and not converting to integers, right, Because 2.5 can't be converted to an integer without changing its value significantly, This was brought up earlier. Division was not included on the list of interred your operations. Even if you have two integers and you divide them, it's gonna give you a float, huh? Because sometimes when you divide two intruders, you get a number. That's not not an integer, uh, the into function if you apply it to a float that's not an integer that's not equal to an integer, right. Like 3.9 is not equal toe an integer value. It rounds it down to the to the nearest integer below it. Right. So 3.9 is closer to four than 23 right? But when you converted to an end, it just truncate. Czar cuts off the part after the decimal place. Yeah, yeah, we're here. Um, then it would probably just get, like, truncated. It would lose some of that precision because because floats have a limited more of a little more limits to them. Basically. So if you tried to like combine this huge and something that was beyond the capacity of float right with a flow, the result would be afloat. That's too large for a float to handle. So it would lose certain values. Yes, this is a very good question. Um, often right. You want to convert like a decimal place to to an integer a decimal value to an intruder that's nearby, and you'd want around it in that case, All right, so be careful about converting decimals. Two intruders. If you use the end, you're just going to truncate A. If you use around, you're going to get the closest one right. So often round is more preferable for whatever you're doing. It depends. Okay? This is another example of how the last few decimal places get messed up. All right, this is pretty close to 251 but it's a little bit off. And if you try to convert it to an integer right, it rounds down. So if you want to convert this to an intruder, it's better to use around right, because round gives you an integer, and it's gonna better handle that slight discrepancy with the last few digits Okay. So honestly, this isn't like something We'll worry about too much, but as you like, learn more about programming. You'll you'll develop your skills around these sorts of corner cases and, uh, it becomes important. There's, like a bunch of famous stories of things going really wrong. This is some space launch going really wrong because off floating point conversion error, you can find a story. And there's, like, links to other other disasters that happened. Major. Yeah, major issues have have happened because of one tiny little mistake like that. So that's encouraging. Right? Okay. Um okay, So another data type that we haven't talked about is is text right? Text is just Ah, a snippet of characters right and toe indicate to python that you're dealing with with text. You put it in single quotes or double quotes. The type is called a string and python records that as str so it knows that you're dealing with text by the fact that you put it in quotes. So here's two strings. One of them is Hello. The other one is world. And what happens if you do s one plus s too, right? The plus sign typically means something to us when we use numbers, but it doesn't mean something to us when we have words right. We never talk about adding words right, but there actually is a special meeting of the plus sign for words, and it's just too smushed them together. It's called Concatenation. Notice that there's no space in there, right? If I wanted to space, I could ad three things. The word. Hello, A space in the word world. Uh, be careful with how you use. Plus, if you're dealing with string representations of numbers, right, this three within quotes has no sort of numerical value on the number line. It's just like the symbol of three, right. So when you add three in quotes to three and quotes, it just pushes them together and gets 33 quotes. I noticed that the output of python for text always has the single quotes. Regardless of whether you input it with single or double, there's no difference to python between single and double, so it just basically, whether you enter it with one quote or two quotes, it just treats them as the same as long as you're consistent. And, uh, it always just shows it to you with a single quote. There's also multiplication. You can multiply a string times a constant and not just repeats it that number of times. So, in a way, it's a lot like math, because when you do something times three, it's like adding it to itself and then to itself again. Right? So I guess I should use them s one. Because I have a value for So if I do s one plus es Juan Plus s one. Right. That's the same as s one times three. No. All right. Now, what do you think this is gonna print? S one plus a space. So that's hello with the space after it is going to do that two times, right? And then it's gonna print s one again. So this is hollow space. Hello? Space. Okay, so, again, this isn't like a major focus, but it's useful to now when you're working with text in the lab. You did some amount of working with text. I remember. There was, like, a capitalize method. Strings have different functions associated with them. They're called string methods. And the way you can access these string methods is after the after your string, you just put a dot period and then the name of one of the functions that's available, and you can change it in some way. So I just did the name of the string, which is my cool string dot And then I tab toe auto complete. And I get this list of what I can D'oh! Right, So a few of them are listed here, //And if you want to know more about what string methods are available, just google it. Okay, so dot replace, replace sort of replaces each instance of the word super with the word. Really, they're in the wrong order. I should do the assignment first and then show you the results. Right? And I can convert to upper case notice that it converted the most recent value of my string toe upper case. So this has the word, really in upper case, right? And this is where things get crazy if you do it out of order, right? If I go back and execute the first cell and then I execute the third cell now it's gonna say super like right here. So it depends on this particular function right, Certain functions taken. One thing like absolute value certain taken lots of things. Like Max. Right? So it depends on what this one takes, right? This one takes nothing, right? I'm not supposed to put anything in, and it's just going to give me a copy with the string converted to upper case. So if I try to put something in there, I don't know, it's gonna complain, right? It takes no arguments, but I gave it something. So it depends on the function, right? Like upper is a function that doesn't take anything, whereas replaces the function that takes in two things what's there and what you're trying to replace it with. So these work a lot like the math functions that we saw earlier, so things could get a little complicated with strings. When you have a lot of apostrophes or quotes within your string, right, because you use the apostrophe and quote toe indicate the beginning of an end and end of a string. Great. So this string has an apostrophe in it. It's part of the text, right? But the computer is going to misinterpret this if you use single quotes because it's gonna think of the first, um, Mark as the start of the string and the second mark as the end of the string. And it doesn't know what to do with the rest of this, So this is probably give you an error. All right, So a solution is you can use double quotes, right? Because now it's starting off with double quotes. It's gonna look for the next instance of double quotes to end the string. And in between, that's just treated as a text character. Well, what do you do if you know you have single apostrophes and quotes within your text, right, There is something called escape, which is Ah, backslash before the apostrophe. We saw this when we did a little woman. The don't was a word that was in that text, and they had this slash before the apostrophe. So that means basically, don't treat this apostrophe as the beginning or end of a string. Kind of like ignore it. Okay, so that's that's how it apostrophes could be dealt with. Um, something that we also saw when we did little woman was that there was a difference between sort of the string representation of of the text, right? The first time we saw the display of little woman it like everything was crunched together. There were no spaces. There are all these slash and slash ends everywhere for a new line. Um, so this slash end means put it on a new line. But if you input as a giant string right, this is how Python is recording it, right? It's recording a slash end to indicate that it should be displayed on a new line. Yet when you when you write the variable name, it's it's not displaying it on a second line. So when you write the variable name, it's basically just giving you the variable as it's being stored, right? And if you want to see it displayed nicely, you print right. So two things to notice it actually treats the slash, and as a new line, it prints it nicely, and it doesn't have quotes around it, right? The output of ah, any string cell is gonna have quotes around it to indicate that that it's a string. But when you're printing it right, it wouldn't have the quotes. Oh, this is another example of things going wrong with type conversion. Um, I don't know too much about genetics, but apparently there's this genetic abbreviation called March 1. It has nothing to do with the date the first of March, but in like genetics papers, they often publishing appendix of their raw data, and the state is often collected and manipulated in Excel and Excel. Auto corrects March 1 to be the first of March or three slash one slash 19 Right so it's came from an article called Excel Is Auto Correcting Scientific Research. And that's not cool. There's another instance of Excel messing up how it represented text. Um, so it says you might be able to suss out that one. Mar actually meant it was actually supposed to be march for March 1. But there's some identify WR in genetics. That's this number 2310 91 3 But Excel interprets the E as times 10 to the power scientific notation. So it it thinks this is just a really big number. Times 10 to the 13. And okay, so stuff like this happens, And the space shuttle example that I gave was another example of, like, stuff going wrong. Um, but the space shuttle thing happens pretty rarely This happens like all the time they did a, um, a study on this. This from 2016 on How widespread are these kinds of problems? And it says the default settings of Excel is known to convert gene names to dates and floating point numbers. A programmatic scan of leading genomics journals reveals that approximately 1\\/5 of papers with Supplementary Excel D unless contain these types of errors. So it's like, really common. 1\\/5 of genomics papers have problems with their data because of, like, just how the data type is being stored. Okay, um, you can sometimes convert between strings and numbers, but only when it makes sense. Right? Str converts a number into a string, right? You can convert the string three into afloat, right? But it doesn't work all the time, right? Certain pieces of text, like chicken right? Cannot be interpreted as a number in any reasonable way. Right? So the pythons smart enough to be ableto to know what you can do and what you can't do? All right, let's finish these last few, and then I'll let you guys go. Um, what you think's gonna happen here? Yeah. So it gets a little confused because it sees this as a string. It's indicated by the quotes, and a plus sign does make sense with the string, right. But only if this is another string. So the type error is telling you. It's expecting a second thing to be a string and not a fluke. Great. You can correct this by turning this into a string. But that's not really probably what you wanted, right? Six point. 03 point. Oh, right. Probably what you wanted was this convert 6.2 afloat and then add it to three. Right? Similarly, it can't convert the string 4.0, to an end. But if you first convert 4.0 to afloat, then it will work. Uh, okay, I'll save my discussion question for next time, and I'll see you guys on Thursday.\""
